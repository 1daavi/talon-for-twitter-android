- Style changes for main timeline activity (long press opens tweet, click expands, this will be an option later)
- Fixed the animations stuttering
- Direct message fixes
- Made profile activities! Yay! Man that was a lot of work
    - Not everything is implemented yet though, but the main part is
    - You can follow/unfollow, block/unblock, tweet at them from action bar
- Expand tweets contents from the tweet activity
- Reply lists now fully working, can't look into the future yet though, only back
- Better handling of dates in the tweet activity

- Way better handling of images everywhere (still can't get instagram yet...)
