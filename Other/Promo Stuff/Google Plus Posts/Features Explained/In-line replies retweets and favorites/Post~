*In-line Interactions* (Replies, favorites, and retweets)

See something you like, but don't want to open the full tweet just to favorite a status? You don't have to!

Talon features in-line interactions that are access either with a long press on the tweet or a short click on the tweet (depending on your settings under "Advanced Settings"). Easily favorite, retweet, or reply to a user's status without leaving the timelines.
